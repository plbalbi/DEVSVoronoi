### A DEVS Proof of Concept for calculating Dynamic Voronoi Diagrams

Also, this includes yet another PoC: A DEVS Wrapper, that by using and exploiting Jupyter and NumPy capabilities, is able to render animated plots of the simulation made with CellDEVS.

In order to use, one has to use a custom CellDEVS simulator, which with some changes, is able to export the simulation made to a NumPy compressed file: and **.npz**. The repository containing this custom version of the CD++ simulator is [here](https://github.com/plbalbi/CDPP_ExtendedStates-codename-Santi/tree/DrawlogToNumpy). Also, this modified version consumes a library which at the moment, has to be compiled mannually (it should be added in here), which can be downloded from [here](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy). Once compiled, the Makefile corresponding to *src/tools/drawlog* has to be changed, to target the location of the just-compiled library.
